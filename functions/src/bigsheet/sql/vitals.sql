-- Vitals CTE chain for the bigsheet endpoint: per-school enrollment &
-- demographics (OSPI report card), per-program spend (SAFS F-196) and
-- staffing/salary/experience (SAFS S-275), one row per (school_code,
-- class_of) including the district-total rows (NULL school_code).
--
-- This is a CTE FRAGMENT: no leading WITH, no trailing ORDER BY; it ends with
-- the vitals_org CTE and is spliced into the WITH clause by assemble.ts.
-- Placeholders: {project} (GCP project), {ccddd} (county+district code).
-- Columns keep their upstream names here; the final SELECT renames them (see
-- columns.ts, the single source of output naming).
--
-- Provenance: descends from data-tools marts/vitals.sql (itself an inlining
-- of vitals_org.sql, expenditures_by_school.sql, s275_school_summary.sql),
-- with two deliberate fixes over the original queries:
--   1. Vocational spend (programs 31, 34, 38, 39, 45, 46, 47) is included;
--      the original dropped the category on the floor, understating
--      comp_amount / non_comp_amount / total_spend.
--   2. Experience percentiles are the exact order statistic — the
--      ceil(q/100*n)-th smallest observation (the smallest value whose
--      empirical CDF reaches q) — not APPROX_QUANTILES, whose sketch returns
--      a neighbouring order statistic on some group sizes.
